Creating a toolkit for algorithms in Computational Geometry
- Menu Interface
- 2D Map
- Graham's Scan for convex hull
- Gift Wrap for convex hull
- KD tree for nearest neighbor queries

1. Run the toolkit with main.py
2. Use randomly generated points or create your own point set
3. Run the algorithm of your choosing.
Note: Algorithms start out in step mode, entering any key will advance to the next step. Entering 'c' will play the algorithm out to completion.
