#### A Computational Geometry Sandbox
- Menu Interface
- 2D Map
- Graham's Scan for convex hull
- Gift Wrap for convex hull
- KD tree for nearest neighbor queries

Prerequisites: Python 3

1. Run the toolkit with <code>$ python main.py</code>
2. Use randomly generated points or create your own point set
3. Run the algorithm of your choosing.
Note: Algorithms start out in step mode, entering any key will advance to the next step. Entering 'c' will play the algorithm out to completion.
